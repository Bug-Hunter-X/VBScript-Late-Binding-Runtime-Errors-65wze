Early Binding or Error Handling:

The best solution is to use early binding whenever possible. This requires explicitly defining object types, reducing the chance of runtime errors.  If early binding isn't feasible, implement robust error handling:

```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Missing.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  WScript.Echo "Error creating object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  ' Object created successfully, continue processing
End If
```
Alternatively, check for the object's existence before attempting to use it:
```vbscript
If IsObject(CreateObject("Some.Object")) Then
    'Use the object
Else
    'Handle the case where the object doesn't exist
End If
```
